# Event-application-ios-platform
This application was a project me and a UI designer worked on. It is unfinished because production 
had to be cut short due to Snapchat new features that revolved around the new Snapmap and events. 
This application was build using objective-c ans Swift 3 along with various apis such as Firebase 
for data storage and file storage. Third party library found on cocoa pods were utilized such as 
apple calendar, and Firebase geolocation queries, Geofire. This app was similar to the new Snap map 
but  heavily focused on event. Check out the source to learn a thing of two.
